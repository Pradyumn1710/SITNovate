There are two types of gesture recognition systems, i.e., static and dynamic. However, our focus in this paper is on dynamic gesture recognition. In dynamic hand gesture recognition systems, the sequences of frames, i.e., temporal data, pose significant processing challenges and reduce efficiency compared to static gestures. These data become multi-dimensional compared to static images because spatial and temporal data are being processed, which demands complex deep learning (DL) models with increased computational costs. This article presents a novel triple-layer algorithm that efficiently reduces the 3D feature map into 1D row vectors and enhances the overall performance. First, we process the individual images in a given sequence using the MediaPipe framework and extract the regions of interest (ROI). The processed cropped image is then passed to the Inception-v3 for the 2D feature extractor. Finally, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is used as a temporal feature extractor and classifier. Our proposed method achieves an average accuracy of more than 89.7%. The experimental results also show that the proposed framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.\\n\\n# Keywords\\n\\ndynamic hand gesture recognition; hybrid deep learning; dimensionality reduction; temporal data classification; transfer learning; vision-based drone control\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nHand gesture recognition (HGR) is a popular research area due to its scope in applications like human–computer interaction (HCI), drone control, virtual/augmented reality, sign language interpretation, and other interaction-based systems [1,2]. Gestures are natural and intuitive to communicate, sometimes with barely apparent body movements [3]. Computer vision exploits these gestures, making it possible to interact with technology without aided sensors. These gestures can be of two types: static gestures and dynamic gestures. Static gestures represent a still hand gesture or hand posture in a single image frame, i.e., relying fundamentally on spatial information [4]. Dynamic hand gestures are represented by continuous hand motion and are therefore represented by sequences of images, i.e., by temporal information [5]. Compared to static gestures, dynamic gestures can represent and enable a wider range of activities [6]. Vision-based hand gestures provide a touchless interface, and the gestures are recorded by an RGB camera device [7].\\n\\nDeep learning algorithms, like convolutional neural networks (CNN), are used for hand gesture recognition. This method recognizes hand gestures with high accuracy without using any aided sensors [8,9]. Thus, the user can interact with a computer system more naturally.\\n\\nCitation: Yaseen; Kwon, O.-J.; Kim, J.; Jamil, S.; Lee, J.; Ullah, F.

However, one common challenge related to dynamic hand gestures is the variability in the length of sequences of image frames in a gesture clip. Variable-length gesture clips pose challenges in data processing, model training, and inference. This also increases the computational time and power. While work has been conducted on achieving high accuracy, less attention has been given to handling the complex shape of gestures. Several authors have reported their work relating to dynamic hand gestures. Recently, Karsh et al. [4] reported their work on the same topic. However, they have tried to focus more on improving the deep learning architecture first rather than on data processing. The authors in [10] have reported work on skeletal-based hand data. For more realistic environments and practical scenarios, datasets need to be more diverse, incorporating images taken in a natural environment. Authors in [3] have also contributed to improving the accuracy by proposing a hybrid CNN model. Their hybrid model consists of a feature extractor 3D CNN module and a classifier module making use of the computational cost and power.\\n\\nOverall, the work conducted so far on dynamic hand gestures is significant, but little focus has been given to the complexity of their temporal aspects. Considering the research gap, we list our contributions as follows:\\n\\n- Extending the work conducted by authors [3], we reduce the dimensionality of the 3D feature map to 1D while retaining the temporal aspects of the data.\\n- Temporal data that is present in the sequence of frames are utilized efficiently by the proposed hybrid model at a lower computational cost than existing methods.\\n- A lightweight model is proposed, reducing the computation complexity.\\n- The performance is improved compared to the baseline algorithm. [3]\\n\\nIn summary, we address the temporal complexity of dynamic hand gestures, paving the path for a vision-based interaction system for dynamic hand gesture recognition. The rest of the paper is described as follows: In Section 2, we discuss related work and methods; Section 3 presents our proposed method; Section 4 evaluates the model and presents the results. Section 5 includes our discussion, and finally, in the Section 6 conclusions, we point out the limitations, other applications for our method, and future works.\\n\\n# 2. Related Work\\n\\nIn deep learning (DL), CNNs are used simultaneously for feature extraction and classification. Using convolution and pooling optimizes feature extraction and eases the classification process [11]. CNNs were first used in 1990 to recognize handwritten digits. The foundation of modern CNN architecture was laid down by authors [12]. Based on their architecture, more robust classification algorithms were proposed, including VGGNet [13], Resnet50 [14], and GoogleNet [15]. With the increased depth of these CNN networks, their accuracy improved, and so did their demand for high computational power. Currently, researchers are trying to build lightweight CNN models for use in devices with low computing power and in real-world scenarios [16].\\n\\n# 2.1. Dynamic Hand Gesture Classification\\n\\nThere are various deep learning architectures for temporal data classification. Some of them are worth mentioning [17], such as 2D CNNs, which are computationally less expensive and are widely used for spatial data feature extraction and classification. The more complex model architectures are 3D CNNs; the third dimension comes from temporal data in these models. Then, two-stream CNNs use 2D CNNs for sparse data classification and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal data classification. While there are several others, the hybrid approaches are the most popular as they increase accuracy while reducing the computational cost. In hybrid models, CNNs are combined with RNN, gated recurrent neural networks, or long short-term memory (LSTM) [18]. In the domain of hand gesture recognition, there exist numerous state-of-the-art methods [19–21]. Dynamic hand gestures are more complex to process as the temporal data have to be considered, as well as', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='cd99a671-e3ef-43ba-8366-ee7df4896b55', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/mnt/MainDrive/Codes/Heckeer/electronics-13-03233.pdf', 'file_name': 'electronics-13-03233.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 957053, 'creation_date': '2025-02-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-02-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='# Electronics 2024, 13, 3233\\n\\nthe optical flow of the data [22]. While dynamic hand gesture recognition authors propose several novel methods, we will discuss the most recent hybrid methods.\\n\\nAuthors in [23] investigated HGR with leap motion sensor-based data, and although they achieved an accuracy of 97%, the work does not provide a fully touchless interface as in the case of RGB data. This work was further extended by Huu [24] while using two-stream approaches, achieving a similar accuracy [23]. In the case of 3D CNNs, authors in the work [25] claimed an accuracy of 90%, but their system is limited to working only under the condition that a person has to sit close to the camera while performing gestures. Another limitation is that they use more complex CNN models for their work. Similarly, in the case of hybrid approaches, another hybrid model was recently proposed by authors [3]. The authors used Google’s Inception-v3 architecture as a feature extractor and LSTM for temporal data feature extraction and classification. They have achieved an overall accuracy of 84%. However, their work could not process variable-length sequences of dynamic hand gestures, and there is more room for improvement in the accuracy [3]. Even if the accuracy was much higher, the practical use of this model in real-world scenarios is limited, as during live feed from the camera, the length of a gesture clip is always variable [26], which the authors couldn’t address in their work [3].\\n\\n# 2.2. Classification with Hybrid Deep Learning\\n\\nAs we know, for a dynamic hand gesture recognition system, spatial data processing is not sufficient; temporal relations in sequences of frames have to be exploited [27]. Various state-of-the-art methods have been reported to work on video classification tasks, especially on dynamic hand gestures using hybrid approaches, i.e., combining CNN or RNN, CNN, and LSTM, and similar other approaches [1]. Various studies have tried exploiting hybrid deep learning models based on CNNs and RNNs for HGR [24,28] and other video classification tasks [29].\\n\\nIn traditional neural networks, neurons are only connected in a feed-forward direction, while in an RNN, the neurons are not only connected in a mixed fashion within a layer but are also connected in opposite directions (both forward and backward) [30]. Furthermore, LSTMs are modified RNNs for the classification of temporal data so that they can store the data in memory cells. These cells contain the output of the previous state relative to the current input. Through memory cells, the temporal relation between the data can be retained [31].\\n\\nFigure 1 shows this hybrid approach; CNN is used as a feature extractor as they are suitable for recognizing image patterns. At this stage, the spatial information from individual images is only processed using 2D CNN, which does not classify but obtains the hidden patterns. The feature maps for all the frames within the sequence are then passed into the LSTM network. The LSTM extracts features and hidden patterns, exploring temporal relations from the feature maps and performing classification. This yields improved classification and better results [32].\\n\\n|Feature Extractor (2D CNNs)|Classification|\\n|---|---|\\n|2D feature maps|Feature Extraction|\\n|frames|LSTM/RNNs|\\n|Spatial data|Temporal data|\\n\\nFigure 1. A basic CNN-RNN-based hybrid architecture.\\n\\n# 3. Methodology\\n\\nCompared to static hand gestures, dynamic hand gestures have sequences of frames where the hand moment and position within each frame are recorded concerning the time. For this reason, the hybrid deep neural network architecture that comprises CNN and RNN is well suited for temporal data classification tasks [33].

[3]. They have used the Google Inception v3 [34] model for feature extraction and an LSTM for classification. In our case, we have replaced the Google Inception v3 [34] with MediaPipe 0.10.14 in the input layer [35]—to remove unwanted features from the frame and locate the hand gesture efficiently. MediaPipe has a built-in hand landmark model, which returns the knuckle points of the hands in an image with low computational power. Using this advantage, we locate the region of the hand in an image and crop the area called the region of interest (ROI). This cropped image is used in the input for the Inception-v3 layer of feature extraction. The highly efficient approach leads to improved accuracy and lightweight models, reducing the computation complexity and cost. The following points are presented for comparison:\\n\\n- The use of MediaPipe as an ROI extractor effectively locates the ROI, reducing the image dimension and computational cost.\\n- It also offers improved efficiency for hand landmark detection compared to Inception v3 alone.\\n- Time complexity is low, and real-time performance is highly durable compared to Inception v3 without MediaPipe.\\n- MediaPipe, when employed as an ROI extractor on the input layer in a hybrid architecture alongside an LSTM layer, as shown in Figure 1, exhibits a significant enhancement in terms of classification accuracy.\\n\\nComparing our architecture to the baseline, we have proposed the following changes:\\n\\n- We have moved Google Inception v3 from the input layer to the middle layer [34]. The input layer uses Google MediaPipe as an ROI extractor [35].\\n- The frame dimensions are lowered from (1600 × 900 × 3) to (50 × 60 × 3).\\n- In the case of baseline architecture, ten frames are processed per sequence, and the proposed architecture can process variable-length sequences.\\n\\nThe processed data from MediaPipe is fed into the LSTM block as shown in Figure 2. The LSTM exploits the temporal relationship of the received data for classification. We replicate the same layer architecture as used by the authors [3], including dropout layers and a dense layer (using a softmax function) at the final stage to prevent the model from over-fitting and classification, respectively. The proposed hybrid model consists of three main layers. MediaPipe is used at the top layer to extract the ROI; in the middle layer, Google Inception v3 is used as a feature extractor for input to the third layer, i.e., the LSTM layer, which is used as a classifier [18].\\n\\n# 3.1. Dynamic Hand Gesture Dataset\\n\\nFor a fair comparison of our proposed work with that of the baseline architecture, we select the same dataset, “Depth_Camera_Dataset” [36], for training the model, as used by the authors [3]. This dataset has been collected concerning different subjects under various lighting conditions. It has six different gestures, each with 662 sequences, comprising 40 frames per sequence. The list of gestures is as follows: scroll down, scroll up, scroll left, scroll right, zoom in, and zoom out. The background has additional people sometimes engaging in other activities; this is included intentionally to add complexity to the dataset for real-world simulation. A depth camera recorded the dataset so that it also contains depth data, but our focus in this paper is a vision-based hybrid model.\\n\\n# 3.2. Data Processing Pipeline\\n\\nOur proposed deep learning-based hybrid architecture pipeline was implemented in Python using TensorFlow. The proposed model consists of three main blocks: MediaPipe, Inception v3, and the final LSTM classifier, as shown in Figure 2. In the pre-processing stage, frames from the directory are loaded sequence by sequence, and every fourth frame is selected from the sequence, as more frames did not increase the accuracy [3]. Finally, a total of 10 frames are used per sequence. MediaPipe is a hand locator and a region of interest (ROI) extractor. The ROI is cropped for each frame.

Therefore, the pre-processed data frame from the MediaPipe block is (10, 50, 60, 3) in size. Inception v3 is used as a 2D CNN-based feature extractor, which then outputs a 1D row vector; combinedly, the size is (10, 2048, 1) per sequence. This data frame is then used as an input to the LSTM block for final feature extraction and classification. Also, 70, 20, and 10% of the data is split into training, validation, and testing portions.\\n\\n# Hybrid Feature Extractor\\n\\n|Input layer:50x60x3|FlF2 F3|FN|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Conv Layer|X| |\\n|Max Pooling|F| |\\n|Inception Layers| | |\\n|Average layers| | |\\n|Concatenation|LSTM|(tanh)|\\n|(2048 X 1)|Dense|(ReLU)|\\n|Cropped image|(512 X 1)| |\\n|MediaPipe|Dense|(softmax)|\\n|ROL Extractor|(6 X 1)| |\\n\\nInput Image:1600 X 900 X 3\\n\\nZoom out\\n\\nFigure 2.

Experimental Setup\\n\\nThe models were trained for 300 epochs, with early stopping enabled to avoid over-fitting, and the initial learning rate was set to 0.001. The categorical cross-entropy cost function was used for training and validation losses for maximum learning. The adam-optimizer was used to iteratively update and adjust the network weights in order to minimize these losses. In the case of activation functions, the tangent hyperbolic function was used for the LSTM layer and the softmax function for the final output layer. For the intermediate layer (Dense layer), the rectified linear unit (RelU) was employed (see Figure 2).\\n\\nThe machine we used for our pipeline has the following specs: We used an HP desktop computer, manufactured by HP Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA, model Pavilion Gaming Desktop TG01-1xxx, with a RAM of 32 GB, GPU of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER, and eight cores with clock speed of 2.9 GHz.\\n\\n# 4.2.

By comparing these results with the baseline, our proposed method demonstrates excellent performance, which can be attributed to our modification to the proposed architecture.\\n\\nWe also compared the performance of our model with the state-of-the-art models. The classification results, as shown in Table 2, were quite satisfactory compared to other models. To compare the computational complexity and memory usage of the proposed model with the baseline methods, we have provided a comparison in Table 3. The results clearly show the superiority of the proposed model in terms of weight and low memory usage during inference.\\n\\n**Table 3.

Discussion\\n\\nSection 4.2 is quite revealing in many ways, as it presents the detailed average results in Tables 1 and 2 and the confusion matrix; the results show uniform error properties across all categories. Gestures like “zoom_in” and “zoom_out” are primarily confused. Still, the true positive rate is above 83%. The Inception-v3 combined with MediaPipe is a booster for enhanced dynamic hand gesture classification. Even though the data were scarce, the model performance demonstrated that this algorithm can perform much better on sufficient data.\\n\\nThe proposed model can also be used in other areas of HCI where temporal classification is demanded with minimal data availability for training. As discussed in the related work, in the classification area using CNNs, the trend is to use a lightweight architecture that could achieve better results for practical application scenarios. Our proposed model paved the path for more lightweight architecture. It uses MediaPipe to extract the regions most wanted from the image (ROI) and feed them to the middle layer for feature extraction. This approach reduces the dimensionality of data and increases the availability of rich features; the LSTM layer further utilizes this for temporal data extraction and classification.\\n\\nOur proposed model can also be used in lightweight real-world applications like drone control where real-time classification is needed. This is because drone control is usually an outdoor activity, and the model can extract rich features with the power of the MediaPipe and Inception-v3 layer together, as well as being able to perform better in the case of dynamic gestures when LSTM is used in the top layer as a classifier and temporal feature extractor. The deep learning models are always data-hungry, which is why the current trend is to use transfer learning to overcome the issue of data scarcity. Using Resnet50, Inception-v3 is one of the many modules used in deep learning models to mitigate the data scarcity issue; the proposed architecture can be used as a transfer learning model in dynamic hand gesture recognition in various HCI applications.\\n\\n# 6. Conclusions\\n\\nIn this work, we proposed a hybrid deep learning architecture for classifying dynamic hand gestures (video clips) for use in real-world scenarios. The architecture comprises three layers: The MediaPipe-based ROI extractor is the bottom layer, the middle layer uses 2D CNN (Inception v3) as a feature extractor, and the top layer is a temporal feature extractor and classifier. The proposed model was trained by the Depth_Camera_dataset, a dataset designed explicitly for dynamic hand gestures [36]. With our best-split data, the model achieved an average test accuracy of more than 89.7%. This can be attributed to our novel changes in the proposed hybrid architecture, which includes the addition of', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='53441eaf-5cbf-4af7-b93a-a1da187ff89c', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/mnt/MainDrive/Codes/Heckeer/electronics-13-03233.pdf', 'file_name': 'electronics-13-03233.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 957053, 'creation_date': '2025-02-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-02-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='# Electronics 2024, 13, 3233\\n\\nthe bottom layer, the MediaPipe-based hand region extractor (ROI), which reduces the dimensionality and computational cost. The second reason is that the feature extractors were doubled; Inception v3 was used as a feature extractor in a focused area, enhancing the features’ quality while reducing the computational cost. The third change we made was the input to the LSTM layer, which concatenates features obtained for a sequence of frames per gesture. In this study, we focused on limited gestures that were available in the dataset; further investigations can be carried out on datasets with a large number of gestures. Also, for real world applications, diversity in the datasets is mandatory, as well as the subjective evaluation of the model. Future work includes the subjective testing of the proposed architecture on other benchmark datasets and training the model on variable-length hand gesture clips.\\n\\n# Author Contributions:\\n\\nConceptualization, Y. and O.-J.K.; data curation, Y.; formal analysis, Y.; funding acquisition, O.-J.K., J.K. and J.L.; project administration, J.L.; resources, J.L.; software, Y., J.L. and F.U.; supervision, O.-J.K.; visualization, Y.; writing—original draft, Y. and S.J.; writing—review and editing, Y. and S.J.
